Subject: [PATCH] make regcomp use JIT if available

If JIT is available, attempt to compile the pattern for JIT
at regcomp time in pcreposix.c.

If that fails, silently fall back to normal non-JIT operation.

Some patterns will not JIT compile in any case so the fallback
must always be present.  It's very little extra work to attempt
to JIT compile the pattern when supported.
