Subject: [PATCH] pcreposix.c: emulate REG_STARTEND correctly

When using the BSD REG_STARTEND emulation option, the location
of the string to match against is passed in as a starting and
ending offset relative to a subject string.

However, the returned matches, if any, still have offsets that
are relative to the same original suject string, NOT the starting
offset that was passed in.

In other words, if the pattern is "d$" and the REG_STARTEND option
is used to match against "abcde" using a starting offset of 2 and
an ending offset of 4 it should match and the match result should
have a starting offset of 3 and an ending offset of 4 NOT a starting
offset of 1 and an ending offset of 2.

Fix this so that it works properly by adding the starting offset
back to any successful matches as they're returned.
