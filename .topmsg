Subject: [PATCH] improve pcreposix REG_EXTENDED POSIX emulation

For the most part, the extensions that PCRE/Perl have added fall
under "undefined behavior" so there's no need to disable them when
doing POSIX emulation.  However, there are the odd few that need
to get escaped (such as backslash within a character class).

Add a new PCRE_POSIX_EXTENDED option to activate escaping for those.
