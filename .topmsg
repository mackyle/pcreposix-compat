Subject: [PATCH] pcreposix: make regoff_t more POSIX friendly

The POSIX standard requires that the regoff_t be a signed integer
type that can hold the largest value that can be stored in either a
ptrdiff_t type or a ssize_t type.

We can just use a long except on LLP64 architectures and we need
only check two defines for those in which case we need a long long.
