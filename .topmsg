Subject: [PATCH] pcreposix: bump version and include location

In order to avoid disrupting existing users of the previous
pcreposix library, bump the major version so that both the
new and old libraries can coexist simultaneously.

In addition, since the include file is a bit different and
is now fully POSIX compatible, move it from pcreposix.h
to pcreposix/pcreposix.h with a pcreposix/regex.h alias.

In this way a simple -I option can allow it to be used
as a regex.h replacement and again the new location can
co-exist with the old location and old header.
