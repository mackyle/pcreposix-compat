Subject: [PATCH] pcre_jit_compile.c: add jit stubs when !SUPPORT_JIT

When SUPPORT_JIT is NOT defined provide stubs as appropriate that
redirect pcre_jit_exec, pcre16_jit_exec and pcre32_jit_exec to
their non-jit counterparts.

This allows clients built against the pcre_jit_exec API to work
seemlessly (by falling back to non-JIT) with a non-JIT capable
version of the library.
