Using "pcreposix" With Git
==========================

Having another tl;dr moment?  Skip to the "Making Git Use pcreposix"
section at the end.

When building Git, if the `NO_REGEX` option has been set (to anything)
the bundled "GNU C Library" regex files will be built and included in
the build.

Even if you did not set `NO_REGEX` explicitly, it's set automatically
for many platforms and forced on always for `Darwin` platforms (even if
you set it to empty in a `config.mak` file) so you may have the bundled
regex implementation in your Git build and not even realize it.

A Git using the bundled glibc regex implementation suffers from perniciously
pathological performance problems peculiar to glibc's regex implementation.

See the `README.txt` file for an example of a regex that causes problems
when using the bundled glibc regex implementation.


You're Using It And Maybe You Don't Even Know
---------------------------------------------

You may have tried to use an alternative regex implementation only to have
the Git build complain and tell you to set `NO_REGEX`.  Since Git v2.10.1
Git requires support for the BSD extension `REG_STARTEND` option when
calling the `regexec` function.

The bundled glibc regex provides this (poorly though, the only part of the
`REG_STARTEND` emulation that works properly compared to the BSD original
happens to be the single part that Git needs to work).

You may think you're unaffected because your platform's regex works fine
and provides `REG_STARTEND`.  But if you happen to be running an older
Darwin system with a perfectly fine regex, since Git v1.8.3.3 you've also
been silently forced onto the bundled glibc even if you have explicitly
set `NO_REGEX=` in your own `config.mak` file.

Git's `config.mak.uname` file automatically sets `NO_REGEX` for many
systems, some of which are quite popular.  So there's a fair chance you're
using the bundled version anyway and even if you're not, if your system
uses glibc you're ending up with just a newer version of the same code.


Git Accepted Alternative
------------------------

Git needs BREs (Basic Regular Expressions) and EREs (Extended Regular
Expressions) to work and the POSIX-specified `REG_NEWLINE` option must work
as required by POSIX and finally `REG_STARTEND` must work at least enough
to prevent reading any bytes past the "end" of the `REG_STARTEND` setting.

The combination of the fully POSIX-compliant `REG_NEWLINE` behavior (when
it's set, something like "[^a]" does NOT match a newline) together with
the `REG_STARTEND` requirement seems to have knocked out an awful lot of
alternative regex implementations.

But never fear, the bundled version is here.

See the `README.txt` file.  You don't want the regex implementation bundled
with Git.  Too bad there's no `NO_REGEX = AnythingButGlibc` option.


Making Git Use pcreposix
------------------------

Are you still having a tl;dr moment?  Then go grab the `config.mak` file in
this repository now and read it and use it.

The unmodified "pcreposix" library does not work with Git.

The new "pcreposix" library provided by the enhancements in this repository
does.

It should be as simple as setting `NO_REGEX=` in your own custom `config.mak`
and then adding `-I $includedir/pcreposix` and `-L $libdir -l pcreposix -l pcre`
in the right places.

And that will work for all platforms except `Darwin`.  Because the setting
of `NO_REGEX = YesPlease` is incorrectly done in the `Makefile` rather than
the `config.mak.uname` file for the `Darwin` platform only, additional
contortions are required to get a Git build on `Darwin` to use the new
"pcreposix" library in place of the bundled regex library.

Add the contents of the `config.mak` file in this repository to the end of your
 own (creating it if you don't have one already) in the top-level of the Git
 distribution you wish to build.

Adjust the `PCREPOSIXDIR` and optionally `PCREPOSIXINC` and/or `PCREPOSIXLIB`
settings as required to reflect the location of new pcreposix and pcre
libraries built to include the "pcreposix-compat" enhancements.

Please note that prior to Git v2.11.1, the t7810 test relied on some undefined
behavior when testing a few of the grep patterns.  Most of this was corrected
in Git version v2.11.1, but a few remain that can result in spurious test
failures.  There is a patch in the `gitpatches` subdirectory that can be
applied to v2.11.1 to eliminate the spurious failure when using the
pcreposix-compat library as a regex.h substitute.  Git versions prior to
v2.11.1 will experience more spurious test failures from the t7810-grep test
which can also safely be ignored.  Current versions of the Git test suite code
as of 2018-03 (approx. Git version 2.16.3) continue to rely on the same
POSIX-undefined behavior in the t7810 test that's dealt with by the patch.
